Hello GitHub user
My name is Jean.
I'm working hard to become a Software Engineer.
My long-term goal is to work either for a Formula One team or Apple.
My hobbies are watching anime and simracing.
I hate bugs and frogs.
I love pizza and bitter chocolate.

When I started learning Python, I thought it was the worst. Once I learned to code in C++ and Java, I also learned to love Python! :,D
